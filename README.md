Waystone -> Xaero's Minimap Waypoint sync for fabric

Since Xaero's Minimap doesn't have an official API, it's unlikely that the Waystones mod will support automatic integration; so how do we get automatic waypoints in Xaero's Minimap? Via a bridge mod like this one. There are others for Forge (w2w and waymaker), but none for Fabric, which is why I threw this together.

Requires:

- [Xaero's Minimap](https://modrinth.com/mod/xaeros-minimap) (tested with 23.3.2) or [Xaero's Minimap fair-play](https://modrinth.com/mod/xaeros-minimap-fair)
- [Fabric Language Kotlin](https://modrinth.com/mod/fabric-language-kotlin)

Supported waystone mods:

- [Waystones](https://modrinth.com/mod/waystones) (tested with 11.3.1)
- [Fabric Waystones](https://modrinth.com/mod/fwaystones) (tested with 3.0.5))

inspired by:

- [Waystones2Waypoints (curseforge)](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/waystones2waypoints) (Forge 1.16)
- [Waystone Waypoint Maker](https://modrinth.com/mod/waymaker) (Forge 1.17+)
